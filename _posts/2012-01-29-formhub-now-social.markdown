We're excited to announce the release of a major new set of features to formhub.  With these updates, we have not only made mobile data collection even easier, but we've started to introduce the elements that will make data collection more collaborative and even social.  Namely, with formhub you can now easily share forms and publish data.

Each formhub user, or formhubber as we like to say ;-), now has their own [public profile pag](https://formhub.org/mberg)e that displays any XLSForms or data sets that the user has chosen to share.  Each shared form/data set also has it's own [dedicated page](https://www.formhub.org/mberg/forms/good_eats) from which you can view a description of the form, download the original XLSForm used to author the form (if form is shared), export the data in excel, csv or KML (if data is shared) and view a dedicated interactive web map if the form data contains GPS points.   When logged in, the owner of the form can now edit the tile and description of their form and share their XLSForm or data with a flip of a switch.   By default all forms and data are private.  It's completely up to you to share.

_formhub User's Public Profile Page_


To make discovery of new forms possible, we've introduced a [form gallery](https://formhub.org/forms) that lists all shared forms and a [searchable directory](https://formhub.org/people) of other formhubbers using the system.

Since we take data privacy and security very seriously,  you can now access access your account and submit data over https with 256 bit SSL encryption.   To benefit from this please access your account via [https://formhub.org](https://formhub.org) and switch your server settings accordingly on your phone. _Note: this required using ODK Collect 1.1.7._

We hope you like these new changes and welcome all feedback.   If you signed up for formhub in our early days, we encourage you to come back and have another look!
