One of the reasons we're excited about formhub is that it provides the opportunity to help educate people on best practices regarding both content and data sharing.

Today we just added the option to select a license for both your forms and data.  The options are as follows:

**Forms**

  * No Licensing
  * [Attribution CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) - Ability to share, remix, make commercial use of the work but you must properly attribute as specified by the author or licensor.
  * [Attribution-ShareAlike CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) - Same as above but of you alter, transform, or build upon this work, you must distribute the resulting work under the same license.

**Data**

  * No Licensing
  * [Public Domain Dedication and License 1.0 (PDDL)](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/summary/) - You are free to share, create or adapt the the data with no restriction.
  * [ODC Attribution (ODC-BY)](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/summary/) - Same as PDDL but you must attribute any public use of the database, or works produced from the database, in the manner specified in the license.
  * [ODC Open Database License (ODBL)](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/) -  Same as PDDL but you must attribute, share-alike and keep open.   This is the license [Open Street Map (OSM)](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) uses.

We encourage you to consider these options if you chose to share your forms or data either through formhub or other means.
