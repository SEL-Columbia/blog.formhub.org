We recently just hit our 1 millionath form submission.  To celebrate we decided to create this map to share where and to what extent people have been using Formhub to map the world around them.  We are thrilled to see the usage spread.  Of note, it's exciting to see Formhub being used in several national level mapping exercises.  

Of note, it's interesting to see that formhub has already been used in several national level mapping exercises.  It's a testament to the fact we build formhub from the ground up to handle as much data as you can throw at us.  

Here's to the next 10 million!
