Last week, colleagues at the Modi Research Group and I presented the following slides to the MVP (Millennium Villages Project) Colloquium. We wanted to share the presentation with a larger group of formhub.org users, in case you didn't know about some of the features that we have in formhub.org (which are covered in the "Beyond the Basics" section) and so you know about some of what we are planning for the future of formhub.org and other tools.

Enjoy!
