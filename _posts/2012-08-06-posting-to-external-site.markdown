We've recently worked on a new feature that allows you to have data submissions to a form be pushed to an external site. Currently you can get json and xml data submissions posted to a rest service that can consume it. You may have noticed a new section **_Rest Services _**in the form view. To learn how to make use of these new feature, visit the formhub.org wiki on [https://github.com/modilabs/formhub/wiki/Posting-To-External-Site](https://github.com/modilabs/formhub/wiki/Posting-To-External-Site).
