                <p>Many data collection projects have strict research protocols on how data can be accessed or modified.  To help with with this, we&rsquo;re excited to announce that we&rsquo;ve added activity/audit logs to formhub.  This allows you to view what actions have been performed on your formhub account, by which user(s) and at what times. To access this log, click on the little arrow next to your username and select &ldquo;Account Activity&rdquo; from the list.</p>

<p><strong>The Account Activity page</strong></p>

<p>The activity list has these 4 columns:</p>

<ol>
<li> Performed On &ndash; The date and time that the action was performed</li>
<li> Action &ndash; The name of the action performed</li>
<li> Performed By &ndash; The username of the user who performed the action</li>
<li> Description &ndash; A short description of what was exactly done and what it affected</li>
</ol>

<p>Picture this! I am in a rural District in India. I have been tasked to conduct a situation analysis of Education needs in the district. Sitting in the District Collectors Office (An officer who is in charge of the District’s functioning for all the Sectors). Where do I start? “I need a map of the district” I call out loudly. I am pointed out to a map behind the District Collector’s chair on the wall.  I begin to hand draw the map on a piece of paper.  The same day I leave with the District Education Officer in a Jeep and trying to follow the map. There seems to be some debate over the map (or my drawing) on the boundaries of the District.  Amidst much debate, I try to plot schools on the locations of the schools on the map. In a separate piece of paper, I quickly write down the name of the school and its needs (toilets (Y/N), water availability (Y/N) etc.). School after school I did this, however it is impossible to cover the district because there are more than 200 primary schools in the district that are all spread out.  In the rainy season, few schools are inaccessible due to bad roads and potholes. We come back and I begin searching through DISE (District Information Systems for Education) an online repository of all schools for the District (for the entire country). I begin searching the names of the schools in DISE to the ones that I visit. “There must be something wrong“ I say to myself. I couldn’t find two from the five schools I visited. “Did I write down the right name? “ maybe that school was in this district, but how is this possible?” are some of the thoughts in my head. In some cases the facility inventories did not match what I saw.</p>

                <p>Hemos estado trabajando arduamente en la traducción de nuestra plataforma para la recolección de datos con tecnología móvil a otros idiomas. En formhub creemos firmemente en la cooperación y diseminación gratuita del conocimiento y las herramientas productivas, es muy importante para nosotros que el idioma no sea una barrera para adoptar nuestra tecnología. Existen 500 millones de hispanohablantes nativos en el mundo y es el tercer idioma con mayor numero de hablantes (detrás del Ingles y el Mandarín),  formhub no estaría completo sin los “formhubbers” (termino para designar a los usuarios de formhub) de habla hispana.  formhub ya soportaba la creación de encuestas en múltiples lenguajes usando las capacidades de los teléfonos inteligentes Android, con esta adición nos acercamos a ser completamente multilingües! Esperamos disfrute del sitio en español y le pedimos de favor que nos ayude a mejorar la traducción. Y muy pronto tendremos Formhub traducido al Chino!</p>

<p>Le damos la más cordial bienvenida a formhub!</p>

<p><strong>formhub Now available in Spanish!</strong></p>

<p>We have been working hard to translate our platform for mobile data collection into other languages​​. At formhub, we strongly believe in cooperation and free dissemination of knowledge and productivity tools, it is very important to us that language is not a barrier to adopting our technology. There are 500 million native Spanish speakers in the world and it is the third largest language by number of speakers (after English and Mandarin), formhub would not be complete without the Spanish-speaking &ldquo;formhubbers&rdquo; (term for users Formhub). Formhub already supports survey authoring in multiple languages ​​using the language features of Android smartphones, with this new addition we are close to being completely multilingual! We hope you enjoy the site in Spanish and we ask you to please help us to improve the translation. Soon we will also have formhub translated into Chinese!</p>

                <p>On July 23rd and 24th we presented a poster on <a href="https://formhub.org/">formhub</a> at the DataDev workshop and participated in the Systems for Mobile Data Collection panel.  The workshop was held during the IEEE Mobile Data Management (MDM 2012) conference in Bangalore India.  Shown below is the poster that we presented.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/lmKFh.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Per usual the statistics are out of date, which shows how much formhub is growing (70,000 submissions in 5 weeks) and highlights the inherit evanescence of data, which is one of reasons we built formhub.  Below is a photo of the formhub poster during the demo session at the DataDev workshop.</p>

<p><a href="/images/posts/2012/08/IMG_20120723_154616.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2012/08/IMG_20120723_154616-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Although it is hard to see from this picture, we have ODK Collect open on the tablet and a net-book nearby, which we used to walk people through the live site.</p>

<p>We had a lot of great conversations with other solution providers and with practitioners.  There is certainly a great demand for data collection tools and data collection consulting services.  Multiple practitioners wanted a solutions provider that would take them (or their clients) from needs analysis and form creation through data collection all the way to results analysis, recommendations, and impact analysis.</p>

<p><a href="/images/posts/2012/08/IMG_20120726_124127.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2012/08/IMG_20120726_124127-1024x768.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>While in Bangalore we stopped by <a href="https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/india/">Microsoft Research India</a>.  There is a lot of interesting work involving IVR (interactive voice response) systems coming out of Microsoft Research India, and it has the potential to integrate with formhub, should the need arise.  We also stopped by <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> and discussed possibilities for collaboration on data analysis tools, as with hexbins additional data analysis will be forthcoming in formhub.</p>

                <p>The majority of recent formhub programming has been performed by the development team in Nairobi.  For two weeks in July, part of the New York City formhub development team got a chance to work with the team in Nairobi.  We learned about all the recent additions to formhub from a technical perspective, set some priorities for the future, and &mdash;&ndash; of course &mdash;&ndash; did some coding.</p>

<p><a href="/images/posts/2012/08/nairobi_office_projector.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2012/08/nairobi_office_projector.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>We worked out of a spare classroom, and made ample use of a projector to review code and make architecture decisions &mdash;&ndash; some functions just make more sense when they are life size.  In the photo above, Ukang'a Dickson stands next to the fabfile, figuring out how to <a href="https://github.com/modilabs/formhub/blob/master/fabfile.py#L60">deploy a specific branch</a> with a one liner.</p>

<p>Of course we didn&rsquo;t spend our whole trip coding in front of a projector.  In the photo below we are on top of the Kenyatta Conference Center in downtown Nairobi.  It is the second tallest building in Nairobi, and you can see the Times Tower, the tallest building in Nairobi, right behind us.</p>

<p><a href="/images/posts/2012/08/IMG_20120714_153626.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2012/08/IMG_20120714_153626.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Also during our coding sessions Larry Weya led us through the new export code.  We refactored the existing export code and it now provides a more unified interface for different export formats with all the data coming from a parsed version of the raw XML submissions.  For the end user, this allows formhub to support deletion of individual records, selective processing on export, and other features.</p>

<p>We also gave a presentation to the members of the Columbia Global Center in Nairobi, and some guests.  Our presentation included the above and now out of date slide.  204,654 submissions is so last month, as of August 30th 2012 formhub is now at 272,300 submission and counting&hellip;</p>

                <p><em>Prabhas Pokharel</em></p>

<p>In this blog post, I want to introduce a feature we&rsquo;ve added to formhub a little while back: spatial summarization using hexagonal bins.</p>

<p>The idea of hexagonal binning of 2D space is extremely similar to that of histograms, just extended to 2D space. You take the range of data, split it into several chunks, and compare an aggregation across these chunks. Instead of the line that forms a base of the histogram, we choose hexagonal bins as our &ldquo;chunk,&rdquo; and represent aggregate data using colors rather than height or width. I&rsquo;ll let <a href="http://indiemaps.com/blog/2011/10/hexbins/">this </a><a href="http://indiemaps.com/blog/2011/10/hexbins/">article</a> do the talking if you are interested in learning more, and move on to examples.</p>

<p>At formhub, we have enabled two different forms of spatial summarization:</p>

<h2>Counts</h2>

<p>This is the most basic (and often most useful) form of summarization, showing the distribution of counts across space. Lets say, in a survey about water points in some area, we want to answer a basic question: what is the distribution of water points across the survey area? While the spatial scatter of the map view already gives us a basic clue, hex bins can alleviate problems overplotting might cause, and give us a glance at this information. On the top-right &ldquo;layers&rdquo; control (<a href="/images/posts/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-10-at-5.55.11-PM.png"><img src="http://formhub.org/static/css/images/layers.png" alt="" /></a>) , select the &ldquo;Hexbin layer&rdquo; checkbox to see this summarization.</p>

<p><a href="/images/posts/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-10-at-5.55.11-PM.png">
<img src="/images/posts/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-10-at-5.55.11-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<h2>Proportion of given response(s)</h2>

<p>This count-based summarization is quite useful, but easy to do in GIS and other software, particularly because a survey will only produce a single unique count-based summarization.</p>

<p>The power of hexbins in formhub is that they allow you to look at your data in a much richer way. In a water point survey, for example, you might care about what proportion of water points within a given area are non-functional. To do that, you would click on &ldquo;View by&rdquo;, find the question whose responses you want to spatially visualize (such as &ldquo;Is the water point functional&rdquo;) and select &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the legend.</p>

<p><a href="/images/posts/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-10-at-6.00.46-PM.png"><img src="/images/posts/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-10-at-6.00.46-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p> What you see, denoted by the intensity of blue in this view, is the percentage of water points that are non-functional in an area. You can in fact go ahead and click on any select-one question in the view-by menu, and select any option to look at how the responses to that questions are spread spatially. We believe this is quite a powerful feature, given that you can choose which response in a particular survey is most valuable to you. In the water points case above, the hexbin density map can practically be used to set the agenda for which areas are in the most need to their water points being fixed!</p>

<p>The caveat here is that a deep blue hexagonal bin may represent an area where the only water point is non-functional, or an area where 10 out of 10 water points are non-functional. We made the default coloration proportion rather than count because we think that is more important and hard to derive; we&rsquo;ll add a toggle to color hex bins by &lsquo;the number of non-functional water points in an area&rsquo; when we redesign the map page in the early fall.</p>

<p>Let us know what you think of this feature either here in the comments or on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/formhub-users">formhub-users mailing list</a>, particularly if you come up with interesting uses or insights from the feature. And thanks to github user <a href="http://github.com/indiemaps">@indiemaps</a> for contributing <a href="https://github.com/indiemaps/hexbin-js/">the javascript library</a> that performs much of the heavy lifting for this feature.</p>

                <p>At formhub, we don&rsquo;t have versioned releases. Instead, we follow the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous integration/deployment</a>&rdquo; model. While we deploy updates <a href="http://timothyfitz.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/continuous-deployment-at-imvu-doing-the-impossible-fifty-times-a-day/">nearly as frequently as some</a>, we do push updates quite frequently; often more than once a day. This makes the standard announcement of features per release a little tougher, so I&rsquo;ve tried to start a &ldquo;new in formhub&rdquo; post per week over at <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/formhub-users">formhub-users</a>.

Check out the <a href="http://formhub.org/formhub_u/forms/Birds">Birds form on formhub_u</a> to see how this works. (adapted from the odk forms <a href="https://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/source/browse/?repo=forms">repo</a>) </li>
<li>A new header and other stylistic changes. We have begun a process of the UI revamp on formhub, and a new header, typography, and other stylistic changes were pushed up this week. Hope you like them!</li>
<li>Leaflet upgrade. We upgraded the mapping library we use, leaflet.js to <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/2012/07/30/leaflet-0-4-released.html">0.4</a>. You may notice a few little changes on the map, like a smoother zoom.</li>
<li>IE 0.9 fix. During the addition of google satellites, we accidentally broke the map view for IE 0.9 users. That has been fixed.</li>
<li>Data posts to bamboo as they come into formhub working. This will sound cryptic to most. But once our web-data-analysis engine bamboo is released, this feature (continuous updates) will make many of you happier :)</li>

<li>formhub can now update an external webservice with data as data is submitted to formhub (see <a href="http://blog.formhub.org/2012/08/06/posting-to-external-site/">the blogpost</a> for details)</li>
<li>Google Satellite Maps are now available as a background on the map view</li>
<li>formhub&rsquo;s xlsform engine now has a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; field (which only takes a &ldquo;name&rdquo;) which outputs a bind element, and  a space in the instance, but nothing in the body &mdash; this was added for those using formhub as an xform-generation engine to produce xforms for commcare, which makes use of these &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; fields to load case data</li>
<li>i18n support: formhub now has the infrastructure to support site-wide translations. Those with their <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-priorities.en.php">browser locale settings</a> set to French should already see quite a bit of the site translated.</li>
